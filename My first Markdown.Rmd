## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.




```{r, echo = FALSE}
numericInput("n", "How many cars?", 5)

renderTable({head(cars, input$n)})
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
### More stuff

got no idea what to 

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
